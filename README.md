## Running it locally

In order to run it locally, you need to have at least Node.js 14 installed. For the package manager,
**we recommend Yarn**, but NPM will work as well.

Once you have everything installed, clone the repository and follow the steps: 1. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` depending on your package manager. 2. Once the dependencies have been installed, run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the development server. 3. To build the project once you have everything set up, run `yarn build` or `npm build` and it will generate
optimized HTML, and JS which are to be run in production.
